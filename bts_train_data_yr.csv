 double standards and many oppositions

i contemplate if i should click like or not
it repeats many times
your heart is like a guillotine
cutting me mercilessly
but, like a goblin, i secretly go to you
and watch your daily life
each time my mind gets filled with the 108 defilements
oh shit, do you think of me, do you?
as i contemplate, i decide not to click like

my father told me to enjoy life
i want to ask my father if he enjoyed his life

and why the unnatural became natural
why am i not in my life and
in some other person’s life?
this is real, it isn’t a gamble or a game
it’s just one life

dream is gone, no time to breathe
school, house and pc room is all we have
we live the same life

for us it's like a double spy between dream and reality

who is the one who made us into study machines?
it's either number one or a failure
they trap us in borders, the adults
there’s no choice but to consent
even if we think simply, it’s the survival of the fittest
who do you think is the one who makes us step on even our close friends to climb up? what?

adults tell me that hardships are only momentary
to endure a little more, to do it later

a factory of sighs while studying, a continuous cycle

adults say that we have it so easy
they say i'm on my way to happiness
then how do you explain my unhappiness?
there's no conversation topics other than studying
outside, there are so many kids like me, living the life of a puppet
who will take responsibility?

yeah i’m the top of the top of the top
poppin em, rockin' em, stoppin' em, blockin' 'em
like the cassius’ lance – imma don
don’t turn the beat off becuz i’m not freakin' done
don’t play around on top of the beat
cuz every kick is my freaking zone
i was always generous
but now i’mma murder you rappers
cut em up by order
then i’mma murder you haters
now look at me and tell me, who’s in your top 5?
rap monster, randa, leader, rapmon, your dad

right now it’s hope world from bts
everyone follows me, my potential gets retweeted
let everyone know my flow
ride your eardrums and fill your bodies
i sharpened my sword for tomorrow

considering my age, i was a kid who didn’t know rhymes
i was just a common kid
from gwangju who looked at idols
now i’ll show you, on the cypher on top of this track
i’ll reveal my aspirations, i’m above the minors
it’s a major different from you, uh
i fill up the tv screen
rapper costume? no, i take away the foam and spit it out
whatever i want – wherever i go, it becomes an issue
if you’re jealous, go to the hospital, two weeks to heal
everyone who hoped for my defeat is holding onto their necks
j-hope plays a foul on top of the game that rides with
hip-hop pride

i have yet to go to the army but my hobby is sharpshooting
we are bulletproof was a big hit
the clumsy fakers was pricked and reacted
feel a little more inferior, the quality of my pronunciation is 4k
i’m dope man, i’m the chopin of the beat
i won’t ever change, i was born a rapper
my attitude is my mentor
even if you talk smack about me, i’m memento
show your hip-hop pride but you’ll still feel impotent
hide your jealousy, i can see your ip address
i’m a boiler, i get hot in an instant
like a spoiler, you’re so typical
fixed up and stupid hip-hop losers with nothing inside
it’s too hard to last in this growing world of k-pop
so just rap as a hobby
it’s the end of the world, if you’re guilty, try harder, what",2013

well-built korean language
only ours goes with english
y’all never understand it
okay, i’ll honestly become honest

make guys want to use it
jeollado words sound so friendly
once i start to use it, i get all happy

if i'm the sun, you're the moon, because when i rise, you go down

hey you brats, your crappy rap is a burden to others
take a break and wait, just go to hawaii, go home
see how far i go, all the rotten roots will be replaced
everyone, let's play a game, without efforts, you'll just be grieving
you think you can do music? just go look for a part-time job
although your short and thin career will get you nowhere
i hope you survive, keep rotting away, that's your label
your life is like a mudfish, your rap is recycled
you save up and divide up the flow, write it up and use it again
hey beat, know that you're embarrassing, just with 24 measures, you lay down sick
compared to your size, your rap is so thin

you know bts is back!

with shoes worth a couple hundred, padded jacket worth a couple thousand
with a watch worth a couple hundred you feel good about yourself
education goes over the hill and student identity goes over the hill too
the class system of the 21st century is divided into two
those who have and those who haven’t
those who wear the shoes and those who don’t
those who have the clothes and those who don’t
and those who try hard to get those things
what’s going on? are you falling behind on the trend?
you whined and complained to get it, did i strike a nerve?
in your padded jacket, your greed fills it up
even after seeing your parents’ curved spines, you’re so coldhearted
you complain that all your friends have it and that they should buy it for you
(ayo baby) stop being so immature
you won’t freeze just because you don’t have that jacket
fill your head with good sense before it’s too late

wow, it feels good, putting on your dirty clothes
you’re something different, rockin, rollin, swaggin, swagger, wrong!
what is wrong with you? you’re crazy baby
that is what will suffocate your heart, dirty clothes

what’s up, kid? you don’t know how good you have it these days
maybe i’m crossing the line for butting in other people’s lives
why do you keep saying those empty words?
i’m saying i’ll spend my own money that i received
you’ll only be satisfied if i spend my money like you spend yours
please go take care of yourself
it’s about your life, if you were me, i wouldn’t say anything
yeah, my jacket is really expensive and not pretty at all
(but i say) i really want it so what do i do?
friends who are poorer than me have it too
(and i say) i have no choice but to buy it if i don’t wanna be an outcast
people my age are all like this
yeah i dunno, yes i’m loco, is it no-no?
i know they ain’t cheap but they got mojos
but i do what i gotta do, i don’t break my parent’s spines
the true breaker is you, who is old and stuck in your room

wow, it feels good, putting on your dirty clothes
you’re something different, rockin, rollin, swaggin, swagger, wrong
what is wrong with you? you’re crazy baby
that is what will suffocate your heart, dirty clothes

dirty clothes for you, dirty clothes for me
everyone experienced it before
wearing expensive clothes and walking on the street, feeling good about yourself
everyone looks smaller than me like i’m gulliver
whatever you wear, i understand but you’re too much
you’re gonna regret it
you can keep your swag on but how about your parents?
fine, i won’t stop you but make a decision now

2007 is when my life changed
it’s been 7 years since i’ve sang
a killer of girls’ hearts
but sometimes, i go back to those frustrating times
facing myself, who was like a white piece of paper
that encounter awakens a different me
now i’ll go up on stage
and surprise everyone by jumping like jordan
ball!
go back a few years
taking out the trampoline from the corner of the room and jump around in the air
you used to feel the joy of each jump, feeling like you have everything
letting myself go to the innocent dreams
my childhood days was impatient to be an adult
but each day was filled with joy
so can i be the one, just can i be the one
that i... stop

beat down, if you’re ready, put your hands up high
it’s different from what you’ve dreamed of when you were little but we have met, we’re heroes, rappers in training
now jump to the stage, we are the new generation heroes
seven heroes-in-training, who were once immature, making a jump sound
instead of a trampoline, the place i need to jump on is the stage, crazily, up down
now don’t just talk about it, it’s time to spread my wings and go, let’s get it started

girl you want my kiss, right? miss right (all right)

your sexy mind and your sexy body
you were even born with sexy brain wrinkles
just in jeans, a white tee and converse high tops
that makes me wanna party on your body
at the end of of your long, shiny hair
your gentle hips sing
you’re like a forest, shining inside the city
with that unrealistic body, you embrace my reality
and i want you to be really really real for me
sometimes like my mom, sometimes you’re my energy
i’m an honest guy
i’m so nice on the outside that my enemies can’t stop being honest
you’re so different from the normal people outside
that’s why you’re called the ideal type
yeah, when i think of you, my heart grows cold
you’re my winter ocean, i want to walk by you

yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
i want to know about your day, i want to become your sighs
yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best

you’re someone who only exists in novels

how can a person be like this?
i start to feel like i’m the only one living in this world
you pass by my side
a sweet wind called you is blowing in my heart
even if you don’t put on makeup
you’ll put on your perfume called attraction
i never believed that there was a god
but now you make me believe because to me, you’re a goddess
whether you’re young or old, whether you have a hidden child
i don’t care because i love you
if i’m with you, anywhere we go is a flower garden
instead of holding designer bags, you hold my hand
instead of jealousy and envy, you understand my nature
with you, i draw out my future
in between our couple shoes are a pair of baby sneakers

yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
i want to know about your day, i want to become your sighs
yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
you’re someone who only exists in the movies
it’s you

i think she has come, i’m in front of the person who shakes up my heart
i think i’m attracted to you like a magnet, right now
your life, your heart, your face, your line
like a piece of a puzzle, you fit into my ideal type
oh god, i’m like the wind that is led by the weather that is you
you’re a flower, i’m a bee, i’m only going toward you

i told you many qualifications ’bout my miss right
but why you’re my miss right is... you are...
just you

Intro: 화양연화 (The Most Beautiful Moment In Life) ,0.257,"the rim looks farther away today
sighs are building on top of the court
the boy is afraid of reality
but his heart is at peace only when he throws the ball
throwing the ball by himself
what i’m shooting at the rim
are my countless thoughts and worries
i pretend to know the world but my body is still not ready
shoot, the court is my playground
with my movements, a small ball bounces next to my feet
the results are as low as the floor
but i just shout out loud to the world that everything’s gonna be alright
but the world gives me fear, then just stop
thoughts fill my head and instead of the ball, i throw my future
because of the other’s standard of success
my worries spread like cancer again, god damn it
along with the thrown ball, laughter starts to spread
my breath rises to my chin, my dreams squirm about
the dribbles get faster, my heart gets happier
this moment feels like it’ll last forever but the sun is setting
when the night comes again, reality gets destroyed
when i snap out of it, i’m just a scared idiot again
i keep getting scared at the looming sense of reality
others are running ahead but why am i still here?
breathe or dream
row the oars along with your heartbeat
if you are trapped in the other’s thin judgements
then the sun will set on your life like a court
what am i doin’ with my life
this moment won’t ever come again
i’m asking myself again, am i happy right now?
the answer is already there, i’m happy",2015

이사 (Moving On) ,0.929,"ayo suga
i remember how we came here three years ago
when you and i used to fight all the time
the wallpaper, bathroom and veranda were all blue
back then i thought this was a big place
but my ambition grew too big
that big house became too small now
when the nine trainees shared a 17-pyung house
seems like it was just yesterday, we grew up a lot
good things were always other people’s things
we were always hoarse from an uncertain future and worries
seeing all the senior artists at the end of the year awards
let’s not forget those things but put them away
this place smells like us
let’s not forget this scent, wherever we are
we cried a lot and laughed a lot but it was so beautiful
nonhyeon-dong, 3rd floor, thank you

let’s move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
let’s move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room
i looked back for a moment
times we cried and laughed
goodbye now

three years felt so short but so long
a lot of things happened, there were many memories
i remember now that we’re about to leave
traces of being used like bank accounts and credit cards
as much as the place was small, we were bound together tighter
fight right here, hitting each other sometimes
maybe that’s why but we have good feelings and bad feelings of love too
even the dust will be cleared now
there’s more stuff than the beginning, i have more than when i started too
now let’s take our pride and go toward a bigger world with a bigger dream
a new start, a new beginning
excited to see how it will become
move the boxes, hold your place, wipe the dust
after you’re done, let’s get a bowl of black bean noodles, that’s right

let’s move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
let’s move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room
i looked back for a moment
times we cried and laughed
goodbye now

ever since i was born
i counted the days for my first move
i remember, why i had to move
the machine in my mom’s heart and the big scar
in winter of 2010 at daegu
the childish me used to measure the size of the world
the reason why we moved into a business
was because of all the bad things people said, saying we follow money
so moving left many things with me
whether i liked it or not, it changed a lot in my life
my life was about paying rent, i know
i lived with my pride put into the down payment
so i’m gonna move again
i’m gonna have a dream, a level higher than being an idol
when will i stop having to move again?
i hope it comes quickly

let’s move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
let’s move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room
i looked back for a moment
times we cried and laughed
goodbye now

everyone’s afraid of changes
staying, moving on, staying, moving on
we keep repeating the same things again and again
i guess that’s life, i’m afraid
old or new, new or old, that isn’t really important
what’s important is, that we still breathe and live in the same place
so let’s move on",2015
INTRO : Never Mind ,0.397,"i only look forward and run
without having time to look around
without me noticing, i have become the pride of my family
and i have succeeded to some extent
they say teenage years mess you up
i think of it suddenly
at that time i was young
and had nothing to fear
a few times defeated isn’t much
if there’s anything that’s different it’s my height
and also being a bit more mature for my age
from the underground workplace in namsandong
my beat has been laid out until apgujeong
the origin of youth
everyone said it, don’t go overboard
if you act as if you’re a know-it-all and will be making music
you will make your home go broke
from that point onwards, i didn’t care
no matter what anyone said
i only lived how i wanted, guided by only my beliefs
in your eyes, how do you think i’m doing right now
how do you think i am
i want to ask the several people who prayed for me to screw up
does it seem like my home is going broke, you bastards?

i don’t give a shit i don’t give a fuck
like i always said hundreds of time every day, “never mind me”
i can have a taste of failure and frustration and bow my head
we are still young and immature, don’t even worry about it
moss surely grows on a stone that doesn’t roll
if you can’t return, go straight through your mistakes and forget them all
never mind
it’s not easy but engrave it onto your chest
if you feel like you’re going to crash then accelerate more, you idiot
come on

never mind, never mind
no matter how thorny the road is, run

never mind, never mind
there are lots of things in the world that you can’t help
you better

never mind, never mind
if you feel like you’re going to crash then accelerate more, you idiot
never mind, never mind

eh, do you want to know my story?
i’ve never told this to anybody
yeah, come on

in the middle of the vast ocean
one whale speaks softly and lonelily
the fact that no matter how much they shout, it won’t reach
makes them so gravely lonely that they quietly shut their mouths
of course i don’t care what‘s the matter or what i’ve now become
when loneliness is the only thing that stays by my side
i’ve become completely alone. it's a lock that fills sadness
someone says, “bastard, you’ve become a celebrity”
oh fuck that! so what?! nobody remains by my side and i'm fine on my own
these words that are easily said towards me quickly becomes a wall
even loneliness turns into something you can see

even if my breaths are blocked
because i’m confined in that wall
(i) head towards the surface of water above
hey oh, oh hey oh yeah

lonely lonely lonely whale
sing alone like this!
will i ever shine so brightly like a remote island?
lonely lonely lonely whale
like this, try calling once again
until this song that doesn’t have a response
reaches tomorrow

no more, no more baby
no more, no more
an endless signal will reach someday
everywhere, even to the other side of the earth

no more, no more baby
no more, no more
even the blind whales will be able to see me
today i sing again

the world will never know
how sad i am
my hurt is water and oil that can’t mix
so only above the surface of the water do i
breathe, and the interest (towards me) ends
a child in the lonely ocean
i want to make it known too
my value, everyday
i become sick with worry, the sticker always beneath my ear
never end… why is there no end and always hell?
as time goes by, it’s a neverland in a cold abyss!
but i always think, now
even if i sleep a shrimp’s sleep, my dreams are like that of a whale’s
the upcoming big praise will make me dance everyday
like me, ye i’m swimmin’

i go towards my future
that blue beach and
believe in my hertz

sing alone like this!
will i ever shine so brightly like a remote island?

like this, try calling once again
until this song that doesn’t have a response

mom said the sea is blue
she said to let out your voice as far as you can
but what to i do? it’s so dark here and there are only different whales speaking entirely different words!
i just can’t hold it, ma! i want to say i love you
alone, i look back at this music sheet that’s like a rotating song
this ocean is too deep
still, i’m lucky

everything stopped like our red light, stop
nothing more to say it ends with my tears, dot
i’m not okay i repeat this denial
recite, if you can recite my mind
this is my last-ditch effort and my wish
you are my endless love and my girl

love is so painful
goodbyes are even more painful
i can’t go on if you’re not here
love me, love me
come back to my arms

i always smile at you
even the love is a tragedy for me
i always cry after it’s over
farewell even though it's a comedy for you
yes nothing is everlasting
i live without you even i feel like dying
(hope it lasts forever girl)
over, over, love is not over
please take me out of this endless maze

love is so painful
goodbyes are even more painful
i can’t go on if you’re not here
love me, love me
come back to my arms
love is so painful
goodbyes are even more painful
i can’t go on if you’re not here
love me, love me
come back to my arms

Intro: Boy Meets Evil ,0.242,"the light of my future is dimming
because of my childish love, i lost my way on a path of dream
the venom of my ambition, i sharpened my knife every day
but because of my uncontrollable greed, my knife became dull
i know it all
this love is another name for the devil
don’t hold their hand
i shouted but turned away from my conscience
i feel the sharp reality more every day
there’s red blood from being torn apart by reality
i never thought that
the greed would become the trumpet heralding hell
breathe

my breath is getting shorter
i close my eyes every night from twisted reality
the music box of tragedy echoes
but in order to be free from this crime
it’s impossible to forget and give up
because those lips were too sweet
i threw my future away because i was drunk on dating
when i woke up, i was surrounded by land mines
surrounded by people’s stares that can’t be touched
i shout for a miracle in this reality
(rewind)
it was crazy good
i was an idiot addicted to sweetness
yeah an idiot
i didn’t want to let go of the devil’s hand

too bad but it’s too sweet
it’s too sweet, it’s too sweet
too bad but it’s too sweet
it’s too sweet, it’s too sweet

First Love ,0.672,"the corner of my memory
a brown piano settled on one side
in the corner of my childhood house
a brown piano settled on one side

i remember that moment
way taller than my height
the brown piano that guided me
i looked up to you, i yearned for you
when i touched you with my small finger

i feel so nice mom i feel so nice
i played the piano wherever my hands took me
i didn’t know your significance back then
back then i was content with just looking at you

i remember back during my elementary school days
when my height
became taller than yours
i neglected you when i once yearned for you so
on top of the white jade-like keyboard
dust is piling on
your image that has been neglected
even then i didn’t know
your significance
no matter where i am
you always defended that spot
but i didn’t know that would be the last
you say don’t leave like this

don’t worry even if i leave
you’ll do well on your own
i remember when i first met you
before i knew it you grew up
though we are putting an end to our relationship
don’t ever feel sorry to me
i will get to meet you again no matter what form
greet me happily then

i remember back then when i met you that
i had completely forgotten, when i was around 14
the awkwardness was only for a moment, i touched you again
even though i was gone for a long time
without repulsion
you accepted me
without you i am nothing
after the dawn, two of us
we welcomed the morning together
don’t let go of my hand forever
i won’t let go of you again either

i remember back then
we burned up the last of my teen’s
yes the days when we couldn’t see an inch in front of us
we laughed, we cried
those days with you, those moments are now in memories
i said, grasping my crushed shoulder
i really can’t do any more
every time i wanted to give up
by my side you said
bastard you can really do it
yeah, yeah i remember back then
when i was fed up and lost
back then when i fell into a pit of despair
even when i pushed you away
even when i resented meeting you
you were firmly by my side
you didn’t have to say anything
so don’t ever let go of my hand
i won’t let you go ever again either
my birth and the end of my life
you will be there to watch over it all

Reflection ,0.27,"i know
every life’s a movie
we got different stars and stories
we got different nights and mornings
our scenarios ain’t just boring
i find this movie very amusing
everyday, i want to shoot it well
i want to caress myself
i want to caress myself
but you know, sometimes
i really really hate myself
to be honest, quite often
i really hate myself
when i really hate myself, i go to dduksum
i just stand there with the familiar darkness
with the people that are smiling
and beer, which makes me smile
coming to me softly
fear, which holds my hand
it’s okay because everyone is in twos or threes
it’s good that i have a friend, too


the world is just another name for despair
my height is just another diameter for the earth
i am all of my joy and anxiety
it repeats everyday, the love and hate directed to me
hey you, who’s looking over the han river
if we bump into each other while passing, would it be fate?
or maybe we bumped into each other in our past life
maybe we bumped into each other countless times
in the darkness
people look happier than the day
everyone else knows where they’re supposed to be
but only i walk without purpose
but still, blending in with them is more comfortable
dduksum, which has swallowed up the night
hands me an entirely different world
i want to be free
i want to be free from freedom
because right now i’m happy but i’m unhappy
i’m looking at myself
at dduksum

i turned my head around and saw you

how are you? i’m doing okay

the pain in my throat gets worse
try to cover it
i don’t have a voice

it’s ringing again, that sound
a crack again on this frozen lake
i dumped myself into the lake
i buried my voice for you
over the winter lake i was thrown

a thick ice has formed
in the dream i shortly went into
my agonizing phantom pain is still the same
have i lost myself

or have i gained you

there’s my face in it
please don’t say anything

reach my hand out to cover the mouth

were the petty arguments the start?
the moment i became heavier than you

is there really a need to keep repeating ourselves

people can be so crafty
we know someone gets hurt if the other is gone
but because we don't want to be the villains
in the midst of a series of vague responsibilities
we became so sick of each other that we finally became parallel
although this wasn't the kind of parallel that i wanted
at first, we showed off who was heavier
we bragged and smiled at each other
now we're trying measure who's heavier
a competition between us
that became a flame, igniting quarrels
it’ll only end if someone gets off right here
acting like we’re comforting each other
with words mixed with thorns
can’t keep doing this, we need to make a decision
if we didn’t have feelings for each other
if we didn’t think of each other
would we have dragged it out like this?
now if you don’t have any more feelings
this seesaw is dangerous
stop thinking about me

Tear ,0.467,"goodbyes are, for me, a tear
without even knowing, it blooms around my eyes
the words that i could not bring myself to say flow down

to me, you were once my dear
but now you're merely a bitter beer
my heart that's stained with belated self-loathing
becomes empty even with the passing breeze
at the end of my play where breakup was a lie
the price that i had to pay came to me
if someone said they would turn back the time for me
would i have been able to be a bit more honest?
the bare face that only i know
the ugly and pathetic old friends within me
would you still be able to love me again like before
with that smile with which you used look at me
stop saying things like forever, forever
after all, the end originally exists
if there's a start, i don't wanna listen to that
words that are too correct or too much consolation.. i don't wanna listen to that
i was just so scared
because it seemed like perhaps i had never loved you at all
although it was late, that you were true
that only you loved me

there's no such thing as beautiful goodbyes

that's right, that’s right, gently step on the shards that have shattered
so that regret, regret, such a thing will no longer be left
please burn up my heart that was torn into shreds
that's right, right there, what are you hesitating for
this is the ending you were wishing for
so go on and kill me without hesitating

loving myself might be harder
than loving someone else
let’s admit it
the standards i made are more strict for myself
the thick tree rings in your life
it’s part of you, it’s you
now let’s forgive ourselves
our lives are long, trust yourself when in a maze
when winter passes, spring always comes

from the eyes of the cold night
i try to hide myself
as i keep tossing and turning ey
maybe i fell in order to take the place of those countless stars

i should love myself (oh)
i’ll answer with my breath, my path

the me of yesterday, the me of today, the me of tomorrow
(i’m learning how to love myself)
with no exceptions, it’s all me

maybe there’s no answer
maybe this isn’t the answer either
it’s just that loving myself
doesn’t require anyone else’s permission
i’m looking for myself again
but i don’t wanna die anymore
me, who used to be sad
me, who used to be hurt
it’ll make me more beautiful

yes, i have that beauty
knowing that is going
on the path to loving myself
it’s what i need the most
i’m walking for myself
it’s an action needed for me
my attitude towards myself
that’s the happiness i need for me

Intro: Persona ,0.652,"who am i? the question i had my whole life
the question which i probably won’t find an answer to my whole life

actually i’m real good but a little uncomfortable
i'm still not so sure if i'm a dog or a pig or what else
but then other people come out and put the pearl necklace on me
ptui!
i laugh more than i did before
i dreamt of becoming a superhero
now it feels like i really became one
but as it goes on there’s so much blabbering
one says, ""run"" another says, ""stop""
this one says, ""look at the forest"" that one says, ""look at the wild flower""
my shadow, i wrote and called it hesitation
it has never hesitated after becoming that
it keeps appearing under the stage or the light
keeps glaring at me scorchingly like a heat wave (oh shit)

you were just digging it that someone was listening
sometimes everything sounds like freakin' nonsense
you know what comes out of you when you're drunk.. like immaturity
someone like me ain't good enough for music
someone like me ain't good enough for the truth
someone like me ain't good enough for a calling
someone like me ain't good enough to be a muse
the flaws of mine that i know
maybe that's all i've got really
the world is actually not interested in my clumsiness at all
the regrets that i don't even get sick of anymore
i tumble with them every night until i'm disgusted
and twist the irreversible time habitually
there's something that raised me up again every time
the first question
the three syllables of my name and the word 'but' that should come before any of those
so i'm askin' once again yeah

tell me all your names baby
do you wanna die?

do you wanna fly?

do you think you're alive?

but i know one thing
my name is r
the 'me' that i remember and people know
the 'me' that i created myself to vent out
yeah maybe i have been deceiving myself
maybe i've been lying
but i'm not embarrassed anymore this is the map of my soul
dear myself
you must never lose your temperature
cuz you don't need to be neither warm nor cold
though i might sometimes be hypocritical or pretend to be evil
this is the barometer of my direction i want to keep
the 'me' that i want myself to be
the 'me' that people want me to be
the 'me' that you love
and the 'me' that i create
the 'me' that's smiling
the me that's sometimes in tears
vividly breathing each second and every moment even now

i can make it better
i can hold you tighter

are pointing to you

the life you chose: you achieved everything without regrets
and on top of that, you have a big house, big cars, big rings
all the things you wanted, you’ve got it all
so what’s the problem? just enjoy it
or just let it go – no?
then run – or stop
don’t whine, just choose one or the other

ayo suga (why?) nowadays this word floats around me
""respect"" but these days i'm confused of its meaning
they say it's said when someone keeps doing something (why?)
i'm not really sure either, brother, do ya know?
it's obviously superior than love
probably a concept that exists at the most superior rank
out of all the superiors
isn't that called respect, huh? (what i'm sayin')
""re-spect"" means as it sounds, to literally look again and again
look again and again and you'll see faults
but you still want to keep looking, despite of that
you'll need that perfect belief towards someone (ayy, ayy)
so i can't get myself to easily say
the weight and thickness of it is vague
i hope someday i can confidently say it
and mean it when i do, to you and to me, huh

please don't say respect easily, yeah
because even i am not sure, yeah
sometimes i'm scared of myself
what if the weak me is found out

(respect) everybody says it so easily
(respect) though you don't know what it is
(respect) please take a look again
(respect) one time
(respect) two times
(respect) i won't say it easily
(respect) even if i don't know well now
(respect) one day i'll say it
(respect) one time
(respect) oh yeah

what is ""respect""? (what, hyung?)
i don't know, that's why i'm asking, you rascal (oh, i see)
what even is ""respect""?
why is everyone saying it
honestly i can't understand
admiring someone
was it something really that easy?
i still can't understand it
to be honest, there's no need for admiration
when there's not even respect
everyone except you knows people talk shit behind your back
i honestly respect you
you have no intention to respect me so just skip it
respect, i respect you

to me of yesterday
to the life of giving up
i let myself go away
but in this world, you know
there are truths unchanged
time rushes ever forward
there's no ifs, buts, or maybes
almost forgotten memories return
touch of the devil, fateful recall
i still wonder, why did they beckon again
every day ask me, guess it, whip it, repeat oh
nothing that will change, so
i lock it up again, close
‘how much love? how much joy?’
soothe myself and stay calm, alone

yeah i don't care, it's all
choices by my fate, so we're here
look ahead, the way is shinin'
keep goin' now

that way, way, way
wherever my way

just trust myself

life not of j-hope but jeong ho-seok flashes by
it must have been full of regret with no hope till i die

my dancing was chasing ghosts
blaming my dream, asking why i live and breathe
oh my god (god, god, god)
uh time goes by
seven years of anguish come out finally
oppressions all resolved
into my heart come answers from my most trusted
‘only one hope, only one soul’
‘only one smile, only one you’
definite answer to the truth of the world
only one and unchanging me, right

now i don't care, it's all
choices by my fate, so we're here

became my fate, became my core
hard it was, and sad it was
still reassured and made me know myself
