Intro: What Am I to You? ,0.571,happy,"come here i’m bout to take u higher
we about to set this love on fire
i’ve never felt like this before
my mom couldn’t even stop me
i told you how i really felt
and in the end, i won
baby you should know you change
all of my negatives to positive
you put up your thorns
but i can see you’re a rose
who’s making my heart race again
the person is you
i still don’t know but
i’ll make you know everything about me
i want to be your oppa
i want to be recognized differently than the other dudes
it might seem like a typical line from a movie
but i have a sixth sense
yo i’ll be different i’ll be missin'
i’ll be kissin' ya all the time girl
i can take my eyes off you but i can’t take my heart off you
now this is the beginning, i’m yo pocket monster
you gave me your heart and i gave you all of mine
today is happier than yesterday
but why, but why

why am i finding an excuse to call you like i’m a sinner
it’s worse than before we started dating
it is not enough that we are a couple?
you always give short answers like yes, i’m sleeping, no
your messages don’t exceed 10 bytes
you’re like a goalkeeper who has lost her will
i’m like messi, running all over the place
i knew this wasn’t from the start
a fair game
it’s not that i wanted to win over you
but i didn’t want to keep losing either
even if we’re not couple-y and affectionate
i want to link arms with you like everyone else
and comfort each other and really mean it
what’s best for each other
the fact that you have a dry personality, i understand
because i’m always below you, under stand
it’s like i’m carrying you on my shoulders
i can’t do anything
my bitter smile has become a habit at some point
and you say you don’t like me but you don’t hate me either
am i rushing things? but if it’s not it, it’s not it
i have a partner in this puppy love
i just want to freely love
hold me, this is like a game
of tug-of-war without an opponent what you say

ah, baby don’t you play
even if you’re a fiery road, i’ll firmly walk on it
so please, don’t look at me as if
you’re looking at a stranger
when i was nothing to you
i keep thinking about those times
what am i to you girl what am i to you
i do love you crazy, uh, do you?
like this and like that, stop confusing me
if you’re gonna keep this up, let’s write up a contract
x number of kisses per day, x number of texts per day
if we do that
will i feel better?
what am i to you girl what am i to you
i do love you crazy, uh, do you?"
Danger ,0.378,sad,"you’re in danger
you’re in danger
you’re in danger
you’re in danger

you treat me like this everyday
you only care about yourself like you are just you
i am just i, that’s your kind of formula
does your phone work right? really?
am i really your boy friend? i’m sick of this!
why are you holding back your expression of love like you put off your homework?
is it like a business relationship for you? or do you hate me or what?
don't don't dig it, don't don't
please be more affectionate! i pray for it again today

we are like parallel lines. we are so different though we both are looking at the same place
you are the only one that i got inside but i feel like that i’m outside of you
whenever i turn sulky you ask me, “are you mad at me?”
have you ever really done something to me?
you are a sweetie! but i’m just a poor boy
i wish the miracle would happen that you love more than i do

you don’t have me inside but i’m full of you. it drives me crazy
but why are you doing this to me?
why are you making a fool of me? now i’m warning you!
don’t get me twisted!

are you fucking kidding me? what am i to you?
am i easy to you? are you playing with me?
you are in danger now
why are you testing me? why are you testing me?
don’t get me twisted

are you fucking kidding me? what am i to you?
am i easy to you? are you playing with me?
you are in danger now
why are you testing me? why are you testing me?
don’t get me twisted

you hurt me so!
you hurt me so!
you hurt me so!
don’t get me twisted
you are too bad to me!
you are too bad to me!
you are too bad to me!
don’t get me twisted

contact. absence. unlock. wanted
i’m searching for your real intention
you always send me just 1 or 2 line of text messages and that’s it
was this really love i’ve wanted and dreamed?
where is the love story filled with ups and downs?
get soap opera heroes and heroines out of my way!
i am tearing my hair out like hundreds of times
you are so calm and feel no guilty, and you kick my ass

what am i? what am i? what am i to you?
i always heard your news not from yourself but from your friends
want you. want you. uh~ i want you
you are trickster. you are a criminal who shook my heart..
i had already wasted my heart even before it started to burn
my one-way proposes are waste of time
if i was not a lover but just a friend to you, maybe you would feel more comfortable. i’m such a love loser

you don’t have me inside but i’m full of you. it drives me crazy
but why are you doing this to me?
why are you making a fool of me? now i’m warning you!
don’t get me twisted!

are you fucking kidding me? what am i to you?
am i easy to you? are you playing with me?
you are in danger now
why are you testing me? why are you testing me?
don’t get me twisted

are you fucking kidding me? what am i to you?
am i easy to you? are you playing with me?
you are in danger now
why are you testing me? why are you testing me?
don’t get me twisted

you hurt me so!
you hurt me so!
you hurt me so!
don’t get me twisted
you are too bad to me!
you are too bad to me!
you are too bad to me!
don’t get me twisted"
War of Hormone ,0.487,sad,"because of who?
because of women
because of who?
hormones
because of who?

thank you for existing
please call me, i’ll buy you food
i think i’m crazy these days
women wear things that make me cough cough, see right through, see right through
(very much) thank you! for improving my eye sight
(natural lasik) don’t need to spend money
i’ll be in panic i’ll be a fan
and i’ll be a man of you you you you babe

my eyes keep turning to the girls (yup)
women are like an equation, us guys are the solution (yup)
wear them more, your high heels
i’m 18, i know what i need to know
that women are the best in the world
yes i’m a bad boy so i like bad girl
come here baby, we’re gonna hit it off

(hello hello) (what!)
(hello hello) (what!)
tell me what you want right now
(hello hello) (what!)
(hello hello) (what!)
imma give it to you girl right now

you’re not mine but you’re the best
my body twists and turns in front of you

i want to approach you but you’re seriously too beautiful

women are the best...
  best gift, best gift
my one true wish is
  only you, only you

everybody say

if it’s you, i’m ok
oh, i can’t control myself every day

great from the front, great from the back
from your head to your toes, you’re the best

  from your head to your toes, you’re the best
la la la la la la la la la
  great from the front, great from the back
la la la la la la la la la
  even your walk is the best

it’s completely ridiculous
i don’t care about women i’ll hang out with once and say goodbye
but i learn when i see you, body 101
(it actually says body architecture as a movie reference, not body 101. )
my testosterone heavily shows up
after winning a war of hormones
i’ll do some research, your existence is against the rules, a foul
if the standard of beauty is in the ocean, you’re the deep ocean
a mini cultural asset that should be taken care of on a national level

her hair, body, waist, legs, even her other unspeakable parts
if anyone says he’s not interested in them, i’d be surprised as a man
the tiniest gestures make me lose it
girl, your temptations make me sit at my computer every night. (looking at her profile)
for her, it’s lady first
women are like cold ice mountains? let it go
a female that drives me crazy, provoking me every day
after fighting my hormones again today, i’ll pop my pimple

(hello hello) (what!)
(hello hello) (what!)
tell me what you want right now
(hello hello) (what!)
(hello hello) (what!)
imma give it to you girl right now

you’re not mine but you’re the best
my body twists and turns in front of you

i want to approach you but you’re seriously too beautiful

women are the best...
  best gift, best gift
my one true wish is
  only you, only you

if it’s you, i’m ok
oh, i can’t control myself every day

great from the front, great from the back
from your head to your toes, you’re the best

(because of who?) because of women
(because of what?) because of hormones
(because of what?) because i’m a man
(because i’m a guy?) because of women
(because of who?) because of women
(because of what?) because of hormones
(because of what?) because i’m a guy
(because i’m a guy?) because of women

women are the best...
  best gift, best gift
my one true wish is
  only you, only you

if it’s you, i’m ok
oh, i can’t control myself every day

great from the front, great from the back

Hip Hop Lover/Phile ,0.795,happy,"people wonder why we love this h-i-p h-o-p, shit
why we got so much guys in this culture, tell me

it was a new world
i didn’t think much of writing or poems
but it came to me suddenly like shim chung
i used to be a flightless bird but it opened my eyes
but people keep askin’ baby
why you love that hiphop shit?
then i tell them, i don’t have a reason
it’s cause it’s hip hop
nothing special, epik high
just like others jay-z, nas
and of course the classic illmatic and doggystyle
in my mind, krs-one
and ready to die, eminem
and the chronic and the next classic 2001
gang starr, black star, eric b
rakim, pete rock and cl smooth
they juss keep poppin
that’s all i listened to
i was like an old lady
i had so much to say that it
wasn’t enough with what other people told me
first, i forced it
layer after layer, calling it lyrics
and that was it! uh that was it
when i became me
on the white paper in between my textbooks
i put myself
and i erased it, emptied it
i was free on top of the beat
seven years ago or now
it’s the same, this is the most me

i’ll be down for your rap
i’ll be down for your rhythm
it still makes my heart pound
it makes me be the real me
yeah i love this

(hip! hop!) has the scent of humans
(hip! hop!) writing down my life
(hip! hop!) is now part of my life
(hip! hop!) yeah this ma (hip! hop!)

yo ma hiphop enrollment?
i felt it with my body as i entered
boogaloo, king tut, old school rhythms
entrusting the beat with rhyme and my tongue
it shows its prominence, it’s rap dance time
yeah ma role model
dynamic duo, verbal with epik high
i’m still inexperienced as i write my resume
breaking down my namelessness, flying on stage
they helped me get up when i didn’t know anything
the artist, ring that rang through my heart
expressing it with their bodies, biggie, 2pac, nas
i found out more about myself
hope hope world
before i made my own world, cole world
ever since he shone on friday nights
i got inspiration and wrote my songs
mac miller, kanye, kendrick
their music hits my ears
the best musicians that affixed
my life’s borders that went crazy every day
endless diction, all right, my instincts choose
whatever rap it is, whatever dance it is
my response is sensual
now my life melts with hip hop
today, i’m wild for the night, my body
feel like a$ap a$ap

i’ll be down for your rap
i’ll be down for your rhythm
it still makes my heart pound
it makes me be the real me
yeah i love this

(hip! hop!) has the scent of humans
(hip! hop!) writing down my life
(hip! hop!) is now part of my life
(hip! hop!) yeah this ma (hip! hop!)

hip hop has found me
just like a child looks for his mother
it came into my life naturally
i was just an elementary student back then
i set up my dream then
i want a rapstar, as others
i hated living the same, the prematurity of a little kid
even if people hold me down and warn me
hip hop persists in me
and completely turns me inside out
the young me used to write
my 16 bars on the corner of my textbooks
thanks to that, i threw away my secure life
and went to a studio in namsan-dong, daegu
all night, i sharpened my blunt pen tip
at the end of my efforts
instead of having a language marks for school
i filled up my rhymes
which made my dreams come true
everyone asks me, what is hip hop?
then i confidently answer, my everything
as a result, my life has buried itself into music
if loving this culture is a sin
i’ll die over a hundred times

i’ll be down for your rap
i’ll be down for your rhythm
it still makes my heart pound
it makes me be the real me
yeah i love this

(hip! hop!) has the scent of humans
(hip! hop!) writing down my life
(hip! hop!) is now part of my life
(hip! hop!) yeah this ma (hip! hop!)"
Let Me Know ,0.16,sad,"on top of this ending tune
i am standing here alone
now tell me
that it’s over, let me know

suddenly, rain wells up in my eyes
you well up, i see you even when i breathe
love blooms like cherry blossoms but burns and becomes ashes
hey girl i know, the conclusion you made by yourself
your hand, your body, your body heat that was hotter than the equator
i’m still here, on repeat on top of the disappeared tune
i’m turning by myself on top of this music that has ended

on top of this ending tune
i am standing here alone
now tell me
that it’s over, let me know

girl let me know
girl let me know
although i already know everything is over
just so no regrets are left behind
girl let me know
girl let me know
girl let me know
tell me something
i just wanna know
i just wanna know
my lingering feelings are trying to withstand the end
so please tell me something, girl let me know

the promises we made disappeared with the time we spent together
the dominos have fallen with our breakup
like juliet and romeo
did i like you too much?
the heat between me and you won’t cool down
now i look back at the film with you
too early to do anything by thinking of you
you took away my stars at night, my sun at day
only leaving me with the darkness of a single cold cloud
if there are hellos, then there’s bound to be goodbyes? never ever
i don’t care about that, i don’t want to stick to that
i’ll turn away, hypnotizing myself

on top of this ending tune
i am standing here alone
now tell me
that it’s over, let me know

girl let me know
girl let me know
although i already know everything is over
although you’re over me
girl let me know
girl let me know
girl let me know
tell me something
i just wanna know
i just wanna know
my lingering feelings are trying to withstand the end
so please tell me something, girl let me know

maybe we’re all just a bunch of fools
everyone lives with a love that has come to an end
it’s not that i still have feelings for you
i know we can’t work out
but why does it feel like i’m having indigestion?
as if my insides will explode, cries come up my throat, making me throw up
in my imagination, i fight with you, make up with you and understand you
your hand gestures, your eyes, they are faded but not gone
why won’t it go away?
why won’t it go away?
why won’t it go away?

girl let me know
girl let me know
although i already know everything is over
although you’re over me
girl let me know
girl let me know
girl let me know
tell me something
i just wanna know
i just wanna know
my lingering feelings are trying to withstand the end
so please tell me something, girl let me know

Rain ,0.313,sad,"(the thick color of a rainy day in seoul)
the racing cars, the squirming umbrellas all over the place
it’s cloudy and the air is clear
(the rain stops and the reflection in the puddle)
with a light gray background, why am i standing here?
i don’t know if i have a lot of thoughts or no thoughts at all
i wake up when it’s just about to get bright outside
i brush back my hair when my exhausted hands
the memopad with the song i couldn’t complete last night
i’ll finish it today as i shut my eyes and let out a sigh
what excuse can i give? i try to make something up
it’s unfinished anyway so i’ll just make anything up
then i turned my eyes to the window and everything looks gray
gray city, gray buildings, gray roads, gray rain
everything in this world is slow
my younger sibling who woke up keeps talking back
i keep opening and closing the innocent refrigerator
with the unknown empty feeling that washes over me
i think that i should just go outside
without even an umbrella
i can clearly hear the rain hitting the earth
i smile, it’s the best background music
like a crazy guy, i start to hum
i wonder what time it is
the thick color of a rainy day in seoul
i still can’t fall asleep as i fade away
the rain stops and the reflection in the puddle
i see myself looking more miserable today
it’s a rainy night, the rain knocks on my window, it hits my heart
with my sore shoulders, i look at my phone and see a text, “how are you these days?”
my friend’s text gets my emotions going
as i inhale the scent of the wet rain, i stretch and go to the bathroom
then i greet myself, half asleep in the mirror
i have no one to meet but i take a longer shower than usual
rain is still falling outside the house
i have no where to go but i take my umbrella
and walk outside without a plan
as if the rain wants its existence to be known, my shoes get dirty
am i someone who engraved my existence to you like the rain?
if not, am i just someone who came and went like a rain shower?
the thick color of a rainy day in seoul
i still can’t fall asleep as i fade away
the rain stops and the reflection in the puddle
i see myself looking more miserable today
i get up and when i feel sore, i look out the window
as if it knows how my body feels, the rain is falling
as i look at the raindrops welling up in the window, i felt it
the tears that were flowing down my heart
with that strange feeling, i look outside and it looks like my situation
the rain that falls like a melody makes everything seem andante
i get ready and leave, opening the umbrella that was as wrinkled as my face
as i walk, the moment i heard the rain
i wondered who this rain was falling for
a sound that hits against the lonely gray cement
come slow down
the thick color of a rainy day in seoul
i still can’t fall asleep as i fade away
the rain stops and the reflection in the puddle
i see myself looking more miserable today
even when this rain stops, when the clouds go away
i stand here, just the same
without saying anything, looking at the world
there, a not so beautiful me is looking at myself
in this rain
in this rain"
Cypher Pt. 3: Killer  (Ft. Supreme Boi),0.665,happy,"kill 'em, kill 'em!

whatever you do i will kill for
whatever i do i'll be real for
look closely, this is the beast mode you wanted
when men smoke, and women smoke wind, i smoke beat
this a beat smoke
who the man told you crazy?
who the fella told you crazy?
i'm better than ya lazy
rather than those who do hip-hop through the keyboard
i live a hundred times harder
they look at rap easily genre, too many generals
uncertain, ambiguous all of them have some manners
those who can't even continue on one verse
because they try to discuss rap or music
that's why here they all still rap the same way like this
only three or two words, they're all critical patients
mother-father aphasic patient all just con artist
back yourself and look at the mirror
if you want to be a piece, make it an original
just try something suckas the sincerity in this is zero
i got by the name of monster welcome to the monster plaza
this a cypher i'm a rider imma ride it like a biker
oh shit slip it backwards beat
you're a drain and i feel content
the kids whose skills are on strike
do so much protest behind my back
man what you afraid of, i'm confident on top of the beat
you're a beggar, from your pocket to the skills you don't have, you're poor
i don't need givenchy cause i'm a star
i don't need hugo already a boss
i'm not buddha but i'm a butcher i cut away your flesh like a
change your iphone
you don’t need your airplane mode
my roaming fees are hundreds of dollars
and you know i can take it more
make money with rocks, sell rocks, you frauds
san paulo to stockholm, places you'll never sit in your entire life i sit

haters i have a lot but no problem, i kill
the shovels digging on my career in order to bury me
bitch i don't care, you can't control my shit
i became a ninja who has endured distrust and returned again

this fourth albums focus point cypher
when this track comes out haters will totally turn from the worse
on this scene that's about illegal things
this songs legality will make everyone fall into a trap
hang hang over bang
explode and come out swag
whenever i go, i drive straight
and wherever i go, it's there the losers of hip-hop
they're at a different proportion of levels to be cussing at me
busy by my talking has come, all unnies call me beep beep
someone's cussing at me
tell them to look at their own situation and then come to me
i don't have anything to be jealous of about others
oh on top of the beat beat i wiggle wiggling jingle jingling
i roll, roll around, act like a beagle, then i start to burn up
strength right now right now
ruling over on top of the on top of the ring
a king who will surpass the name of a god
this is just a sample, just a snack
my rap will soon be a korean meal to fill your stomach
that's right, my nation korea
all the rap mansiks' trying to spit out poor english
look at who's on top of you now

haters i have a lot but no problem, i kill
the shovels digging on my career in order to bury me
bitch i don't care, you can't control my shit
i became a ninja who has endured distrust and returned again

s-u-g-a a.k.a agust d, my second name
when i walk in the streets, they whisper my name
from daegu to apgujeong my beat that have been laid
the lives of my music that breath and live here and there all over the world
i’m a baby shaman who dances on the jakdu called the beat, that’s me
my self that is shown through the tv
did you know that half of it is a kagemusha?
you're all just big talk with your mouth, but that's rapping
the spirit of my heavy king rap that hits towards the lies of the solicit nompaengis
rappers who act arrogant
my flow job that takes them all and toys around with them
if you try to damage me with simple words like that
i only become stronger
the mysterious me is a bulgasari who grows by eating your jealousy and envy
like you all know my voice turns people on
whether it be men or women
my flexible tongue movements will send them to hong kong with my raps
on top of the food chain
i'm always on the highest point of the summit
my idiocy that won't end
even if someone tries to try to fuck me over from the back
while you guys play around
we're going around the world
hyungnims who gained age carelessly
from my standards, you're at the level of a kid too
even if i'm wack or if i'm fake if i'm this or that
i'm the new standard of the music industry
this rap will throw a slap an endless slap at their ears chop chop chop

haters i have a lot but no problem, i kill
the shovels digging on my career in order to bury me
bitch i don't care, you can't control my shit
i became a ninja who has endured distrust and returned again"

Blanket Kick/Embarrassed ,0.552,happy,"(one, two, three, four)
i’m doing so many things, i’ve become a tree
why am i getting weirder in front of you?
i’m not a pre-schooler but why is everything so childish?
look at my eyes, my jokes aren’t serious
saying this is so hard, i like you
i was too shy to become your sun so i became a cold moon
but afterwards, i keep making a wave of blankets on top of my ocean bed
i jump around like a crazy guy
winning over my embarrassed feelings with some ufc moves
with a high kick and a jab and a hook
with some pounding, i let it all out in my blanket
oh gimme an iron so i can smooth out my hands and feet
you have already made it into several lines of my lyrics
it’s even more than that, but my poor blanket
i just wish you were here
only you only you
again, i’m acting weird in front of you
you’re so pretty pretty pretty
but why am i like this?
i sleep and kick my blankets around
only you woo woo woo woo woo (you!)
you woo woo woo woo woo (you!)

i’m not a pencil but i keep getting dark thoughts toward you
did you notice my dark thoughts?
i try to hide it but i can’t, it’s just useless efforts
time goes tick tock and when i’m in front of your house
i try to set the mood
this time, i’ll really pretend i’m crazy
and give you a deep kiss so i grab your shoulders
but then the phone rings
your dad asks when you’re coming back home
oh my god, the mood was so good
before i sleep, i get angry at my blanket again
it was so good…
only you only you
again, i’m acting weird in front of you
you’re so pretty pretty pretty
but why am i like this?
i sleep and kick my blankets around
should i go or not? then i went
should i do it or not? then i did it
making jokes and playing around, getting physical and acting cute
but my arrow keeps missing your target
where is it? is that where your heart is? why did i do that the other day?

Life Goes On ,0.45,sad,"I remember
I, I, I remember
Ah, ah
One day, the world stopped
Without any warning
Spring didn't know that it had to wait
Showed up not even a minute late
Streets erased all of footprints
I lie here, fallen to the ground
Time goes by on its own
Without a single apology
It looks like it's going to rain again today
I'm soaked to the bone
Still won't stop
Running faster than that cloud of rain
Thought that would be enough
Guess I'm only human after all
It hurts so bad
This cold that the world gave me
Prompts me to press the dust-covered rewind
Dancing off-beat lying on the ground
Once winter comes, let's exhale a warmer breath
There's no end in sight
Is there a way out?
My feet refuse to move, oh
Close your eyes for a moment
Hold my hand
To the future, let's run away
Like an echo in the forest
The day will come back around
As if nothing happened
Yeah, life goes on
Like an arrow in the blue sky
Another day flying by
On my pillow, on my table
Yeah, life goes on
Like this again
Let me tell you with this song
People say the world has changed
Mh-hm-hm-hm
But thankfully between you and me
Nothing has changed
With the 'annyeong' that we start and finish the day with
Let us thread tomorrow with today (Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh-woah)
Stopped for now, but don't hide in the shadow
Only again, daylight will glow
There's no end in sight
Is there a way out?
My feet refuse to move, oh
Close your eyes for a moment
Hold my hand (Hold it)
To the future, let's run away (Oh, oh, oh)

Get me outta my blues
And now I'm feelin' brand new
Everyday
It's so frustrating, it's driving me crazy
Feel like it's still day one
Somebody turn back the clock
The entire year got stolen
I'm still in bed
A bloated stomach
It's killin' me slowly, nah
Anyway
I want to leave any way
There's no way
This room is all I have
Then, what can I do here?
Into my world
Let's change it, yeah
Let's go, let me fly to my room
Lower your gaze and zoom anywhere
Come on now, let me fly to my room

I wonder if this place was like this
Suddenly this strange scenery
I'm absorbed by memories
Even the old desks, the changed sunlight
Looks special
I'm little less lonely, nah
Better way
I just found a better way
Sometimes we get to know
Broken is beautiful
My body is light

Landing over the bed
This is the safest place
Somehow there's no joy, no sadness, no emotion
It's just me here
Sometimes this room becomes an emotional trash can
It hugs me
They greet me again
The toys in my room, like people
It's as crowded as if we're out of the city
The TV sound
I just have to change my thoughts
This is a journey that only I can enjoy
Delivery food
Fill it up with optimism, I'm full

Blue & Grey ,0.364,sad,"Where is my angel?
The end of the day
Someone come and save me, please
A weary sigh of a tiring day
I guess everyone's happy
Can you look at me? 'Cause I am blue and grey
The meaning of the tears reflected in the mirror
My color hidden with a smile, blue and grey
I don't know where it went wrong
Since my youth, I've had a blue question mark in my head
Maybe that's why I've been living so fiercely
But when I look back, I'm all by myself
That hazy shadow that swallows me up
The blue question mark still exists
Is it anxiety or depression?
How am I so regretful?
Or is it just me, one that loneliness gave birth to
I still don't know, the ferocious blue
I hope I don't erode away, I'll find the exit
I just wanna be happier
To melt the cold me
My hands have reached out countless times
Colorless echo
Oh, this ground feels so heavier
I am singing by myself
I just wanna be happier
Am I being too greedy?
I felt when I walked on the cold winter streets
The sound of my fast heartbeat breathing
I still feel it
Don't say it's okay
'Cause it's not okay
Please don't leave me alone, it hurts too much
On the road I always walk
There is a light that always shines
But today, the scene feels unfamiliar
Is it dull or is it broken?
This lump of metal feels heavy
A grey rhino is approaching
I'm just standing there without focus
I don't feel like myself at this moment
I'm just not scared
I don't believe in a God called conviction
Words like color make me cringe
A vast grey area is way more comfortable
Hundreds of millions of grey facial expressions here
When it rains, it's my world
I dance over this city
On a clear day, bring some fog
On rainy days, we're always together
A toast to all the dust here
I just wanna be happier
Please feel the warmth of my hands
They're not warm, so I need you more
Oh, this ground feels so heavier

In the distant future, when I smile
I'll tell you I did

'Cause we don't need permission to dance
